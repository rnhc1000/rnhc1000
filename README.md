### About Me :sunglasses:
I am a Full Stack Software Engineer :hammer_and_wrench: who loves to design, code and deploy business applications. I have been very succesful in being the architect of  solutions that have met and even exceed businesses and customers requirements in all companies I have been working for, since the very beginning of my career as a Junior Engineer. As playing into this market for almost 25 years :detective: I have been exposed to a myriad of technologies and for some of them, being a very early adopter. My first contact with a programming language was Pascal in the university, where I learnt the key concepts of any programming language, but my first professional job was to deal with  Assembler (8085, 8086 and Z-80) and C languages, building device drivers for mass storage devices for the x86 platform (yep, XT and AT IBM PCs), having Turbo C and Turbo Assembler, by Herbert Schildt, as my bedside books to put some light on to those hours coding in C and using inline Assembler :man_technologist:. Loved it :cupid: ... Moved to the networking market to surf the wave of the Internet at its infancy in the 90s and got the most of that including some Cisco Networking certifications and from that jumped to Web world :spider_web: and back to software development using LAMP... :woozy_face: Yeah ... Good times, where you did not have available frameworks suchs as ReactJS, Angular and others available today to help you build a professional UI/UX front-end of a web-based application... Back again to the university :man_student: to get a Software Engineering postdegree and dove deeply into the OOP concepts, Java and Spring framework to increase my game and worked hard over the past years, to keep delivering clean, stable, mantainable and scalable applications. Currently, I have been playing with ReactJS, yes... I do HTML, CSS, JavaScript and last but not least ReactJS, API, CI/CD, Jenkins, SonarQube, SOLID, and so many exciting technologies to provide secure first financial applications available at your fingertips across the country. Take a look at https://ferreiras.dev.br :sunglasses: to know more about my professional career. As far as the picture above is concerned :construction_worker_man:, it shows exactly what I like the most :two_hearts:, build web applications in a first-class team environment... Enjoy this repository! :partying_face:
