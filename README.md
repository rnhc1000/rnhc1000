## About Me
I am a Sr Software Engineer who loves to design, code and deploy businness applications. I have been very succesful in being the architect of some very good solutions to businnesses and customer requirements in all companies I have been working for since the very beginning of my career as a Junior Engineer. As playing into this market for almost 20 years I have been exposed to a myriad of technologies and for somae of them being a very early adopter. My first contact with a programming language was Pascal where I learnt the basics of any programming language but my first professional task was to deal with  Assembler (8085, 8086 and Z-80) and C language building device drivers for mass storage devices for the x86 platform (hehe, XT and AT IBM PCs). Moved to the networking market to surf the wave of the Internet at its infancy in 90s and get the most of that including some Cisco Networking certifications and from that to Web world using LAMP... Yeah .... Good times where you did not have available all the frameworks available today to build a web site.... Back to the university to get a Softwre Engineering diploma and dive into the OOP, Java and Spring to increase my game and working hard to deliver clean, stable, mantainable and scalable applications. Currently, I have been playing with CI/CD, Jenkins, SonarQube, SOLID, and so may exciting technologies to have secure first financial applications available at your fingertips across the country.... Th picture shows exactly what I like the most build applications in a team environment.... Enjoy this repository!
