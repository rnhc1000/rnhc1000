## About Me
I am a Sr Software Engineer who loves to design, code and deploy business applications. I have been very succesful in being the architect of some very succesful solutions to meet and even exceed business and customer requirements in all companies I have been working for since the very beginning of my career as a Junior Engineer. As playing into this market for almost 25 years I have been exposed to a myriad of technologies and for some of them being a very early adopter. My first contact with a programming language was Pascal in the university where I learnt the basics of any programming language but my first professional task was to deal with  Assembler (8085, 8086 and Z-80) and C language, building device drivers for mass storage devices for the x86 platform (hehe, XT and AT IBM PCs), having Turbo C and Turbo Assembler by Herbert Schildt as my prefered company to those obscure hours programming in C and using inline Assember. Love it... Moved to the networking market to surf the wave of the Internet at its infancy in the 90s and get the most of that including some Cisco Networking certifications and from that to Web world and back to software development using LAMP... Yeah .... Good times where you did not have available all the frameworks available today to build a web site.... Back to the university to get a Software Engineering postdegree and dive into the OOP concepts, Java and Spring to increase my game and working hard to deliver clean, stable, mantainable and scalable applications. Currently, I have been playing with ReactJS, yes... I do HTML,CSS,JavaScript and last but not least ReactJS, API, CI/CD, Jenkins, SonarQube, SOLID, and so many exciting technologies to provide secure first financial applications available at your fingertips across the country. Take a look at https://pay.simatef.com.br. As far as the picture is concerned it shows exactly what I like the most, build applications in a team environment... Enjoy this repository!
